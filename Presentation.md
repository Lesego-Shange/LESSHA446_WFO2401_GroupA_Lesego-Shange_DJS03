# Presentation on Refactoring Decisions

## Rationale behind Refactoring Decisions

### Choice of Objects and Functions

- **Objects:**

  - Refactored to introduce helper functions (`createElement`, `createOption`, etc.) for encapsulating DOM manipulation.
  - Improved readability and maintainability by separating concerns.

- **Functions:**
  - Functions introduced to modularize the code:
    - `renderBook`: Generates HTML for a book preview.
    - `updateBookList`: Updates the book list based on search filters and pagination.

## Abstraction for Maintainability and Extendability

### Abstraction

- **DOM Manipulation:**

  - Abstracted DOM manipulation into helper functions.
  - Encapsulated logic to improve reusability.

- **Event Handling:**

  - Centralized event handling in `setupEventListeners`.
  - Reduced repetitive code and improved code organization.

- **Component Logic:**
  - Separated logic for rendering books, updating the book list, and handling search and pagination.
  - Easier to modify and extend functionality.

### Benefits

- **Readability:**

  - Cleaner and more concise code with clear separation of concerns.

- **Maintainability:**

  - Easier to update or modify functionality without impacting other parts of the code.

- **Extendability:**
  - New features or components can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

### Challenges

- **Initial Structure:**

  - Original code tightly coupled with DOM manipulation.
  - Lack of separation of concerns.

- **Refactoring Complexity:**

  - Balancing abstraction while keeping the code simple and readable.

- **Testing:**
  - Ensuring functionality across different browsers and conditions.

### Overcoming Challenges

- **Gradual Refactoring:**

  - Refactoring in smaller steps, focusing on one aspect at a time.

- **Testing and Debugging:**
  - Using browser developer tools to test each step and ensuring functionality.
